# Purpose

This project is designed to give a brief description of the creator's, Brandon Wetzel, skills and accomplishments.

# Visualizing of Site

This project is designed to be hosted using GH pages. Here is a [link](https://bcm101.github.io/bwetzel_resume/).

# Running of Site

download, CC into directory, and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

This will start a local version of the resume site for you to edit and play around with. 

# File System?

The part that makes this project really special to me is that I really tried to create a semi-working linux terminal. This includes several commands, all of which can be seen using the help command. This also includes the pipe operator, '|', and the logical AND operator'&&'. The commands that have been implemented along with their options can be seen using the 'help' command. For example, to remove a directory named 'world' in a directory called 'hello', along with all its contents, one would type the command 

```bash
rm -r hello/world
```

# some files or folders are missing in the terminal?

This is expected behaviour in the case where you have deleted a file or folder with a command such as 'rm'. In this case, you would likely need to delete your local data in indexedDB, which can be done using the icon behind the linux terminal labeled 'reset local data' or by running the command 'DELETE_DB' in the terminal. Afterwards, if you refresh the page all the files will be back to where they were originally. If a file is missing that is user created, I have no access to that and could be caused by a number of issues involving your browser.

# Getting Started with Create React App
