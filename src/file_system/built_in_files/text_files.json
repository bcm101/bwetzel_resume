I graduated in 2024 with a Master's degree in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics from the University of Massachussets Dartmouth. I was top of my class with a GPA of 3.99 with which I received several awards and scholarships. I wrote my Master's thesis on how to improve trust in AI by storing Machine Learning models in a decentralized blockchain environment. I have worked several summers as a web developement intern at Loomis Sayles based on Boston. I also have been a teacher's assistant for two Master's level Computer Science classes, and a mentor for an undergraduate Computer Science course.", "remove_spaces": true, "className": "opened-file"},
